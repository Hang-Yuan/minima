My CMU mini 1 is at a finale. I am taking two exams tomorrow.

Pittsburgh comes the autumn, which is nothing more than cold, lonely and boring. 

In this autumn, I can hardly find anything inspiring or excited me. I believe the best mindset facing this circumstance is self-decipline, self-awareness, and self-achievement.

I make this website trying to communicate to someone I am trying to become. And I want to take efforts to become who I want to be.
